"""graph/topological_sort.py
This module implements topological sorting for a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge
from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. It's often used in scenarios
where you want to schedule tasks that have dependencies on each other.

Topological sorting is only possible for DAGs because it ensures no cycles exist, which
would otherwise prevent a linear ordering. Itâ€™s useful for task scheduling, resolving
symbol dependencies in linkers, and determining compilation order.

Returns:
    list: A list of vertices in topologically sorted order.

# Example usage:
g = TopologicalSort(6)
g.add_edge(5, 2)
g.add_edge(5, 0)
g.add_edge(4, 0)
g.add_edge(4, 1)
g.add_edge(2, 3)
g.add_edge(3, 1)

print("Topological Sort:")
print(g.topological_sort())
